        The State of Today’s Church
      </h2>
      <div class="muted">
        <p><strong>Dear Reader,</strong></p>
        <p>
          Perhaps you will wonder why I speak the way I speak as a Christian author, and why my book questions so many common church practices.
          Please be aware, however, that I am not questioning the validity or importance of the church, nor am I suggesting that people should abandon the institutional church.
        </p>
        <p>
          Rather, I invite you as an individual to judge and decide for yourself. I ask that we thoughtfully consider the source of our church traditions
          and examine how these practices align with Scripture and the practices of the first-century church.
        </p>
        <p>
          Many hold firmly to tradition even when it is not grounded in Scripture, and then wonder why the church appears to be losing relevance and impact in the contemporary world.
        </p>
        <p>
          This book points out areas where contemporary church life violates biblical principles. Whether or not you agree with every conclusion, the realities revealed cannot be ignored.
          This is a scholarly work with an explosive conclusion.
